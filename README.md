An account is a container for all of the activity associated with a particular user's wallet on the blockchain. This includes all of their tokens, posts, comments, upvotes, transfers, etc.

Each Account has multiple authority and keys to manager different permissions on the platform

Keys are used to authenticate transactions. Each key contains a public/private pair. When a transaction is submitted to the Hive blockchain, it is signed by the account owner using their private key. The blockchain is able to determine that the transaction is valid by validating the signature against the public key from the pair.
